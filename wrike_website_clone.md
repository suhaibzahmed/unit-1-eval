## Introduction
Our obejective was to create a pixel-perfect clone of the website - wrike.com, which is a digital work management tool that lets users track and coordinate projects.
Our clone consists of 5 pages - Home Page, Project Template page, All Teams page, Pricing page and Contact Us page. The website has basic functionalities like - hovering effects, scroll effect, and shows invalid user input error messages.

## Different Pages
#### Home Page
The Home Page is the first page of the clone, which connects to all other pages. It consists of a fixed navigation bar with a dropdown menu for each of the options. The navigation bar is common for all the pages. The home page has information about the company, its clients, its objectives, and a footer which is common in every page.

#### Project Template Page
The Project Template page has featured templates in the form of cards built using grids. It has a form where the user can enter details. If the user fails to enter details for a particular field, our code generates an error message, warning the user to enter the correct fields.

#### All Teams Page
This page consists of a form for the user to enter his/her email if he/she is intested. Trying to submit the form without any inputs will generate an error message. The All Teams page also consists of cards with some cool hovering effects, which changes the colors of the fonts as well as the background image.

#### Pricing Page
The Pricing page has different options which allows the user to choose his/her plan. This page shows all the available plans that the user can choose from.

#### Contact Us Page
This page is basically for the user to enter his/her details if he/she is interested to have a demo shown to them.
